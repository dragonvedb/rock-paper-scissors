# rock-paper-scissors

31st of October:

I am finally beginning the work on the first *actual* programm within The Odin Project. It will be fairly simple and lack any interface (for now, presumably), but I'm not sure if I ever coded something more complicated as part of freeCodeCamp in JavaScript specifically. Pretty excited. So far figuring out how to make the programm do some simple sequence pf actions without overcomplicating the code too much has been more stimulating then HTML/CSS.

3rd of November:

The project was done yesterday evening. It was an enjoyable experience, especially if you're trying to do it "elegantly" and using a bit less obvious methods, like anonymous functions or ternary operators. (Side note: switches are *incredibly* useful).
Overall wasn't very challenging, though I had to rewrite certain parts several times because otherwise I couldn't implement something else. Scope is bitch.
One interesting bug was being able to trigger "no input" message by typing in 'null' due to the way I coded it (converting input to string before checking validity, because otherwise it broke 'toLowerCase').
At the last moment implemented emoji input support. It's fun on mobile.
Where to next?

25th of November:

Here we go again! This time around we're adding the UI elements which is going to be a huge relief, cause the endless alerts are honesly super annoying and also buggy. Don't yet know how I'm going to style the site; I had an idea of theming it around Undertale (Omega Flowey battle?..) but it may be to much hassle to be honest. We'll see.
God, there's so much to rework...

6th of December:

The site is finished for good (i hope). I've spent too much time on it anyway, obsessing over minutae of layout and trying to make it look good on phones for no reason.
I am extremely pleased with how it turned out and with the look I stumbled onto; this sort of neon tableu with an aesthetic that I don't know the name of but definetely know exists. Also, it forced me to remember how HTML/CSS work and what you can do with them.
And it sure taught me a LOT about DOM manipulation.
