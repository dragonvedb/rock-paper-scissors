# rock-paper-scissors

31st of October:

I am finally beginning the work on the first *actual* programm within The Odin Project. It will be fairly simple and lack any interface (for now, presumably), but I'm not sure if I ever coded something more complicated as part of freeCodeCamp in JavaScript specifically. Pretty excited. So far figuring out how to make the programm do some simple sequence pf actions without overcomplicating the code too much has been more stimulating then HTML/CSS.
